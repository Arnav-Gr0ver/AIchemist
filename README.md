# **AIchemist - Automated Blind Paper Replication in Sandbox** 

## **Overview**  
This project automates the replication of research papers with code in a sandboxed environment. It retrieves papers, sets up dependencies, executes code in isolation, verifies results, and iterates on failures.  

## **Workflow**  
1. **Paper & Code Retrieval** – Fetches research papers and associated code.  
2. **Task Planning** – Breaks down execution steps.  
3. **Sandbox Setup** – Creates an isolated execution environment.  
4. **Dependency Resolution** – Installs required libraries.  
5. **Code Execution** – Runs the paper’s implementation.  
6. **Logging & Monitoring** – Captures outputs and errors.  
7. **Result Verification** – Compares execution results with expected outcomes.  
8. **Error Handling & Iteration** – Adapts and re-executes failed runs.  
9. **Report Generation** – Summarizes execution details and findings.
